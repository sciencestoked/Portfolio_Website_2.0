        <p>As a mentor at BeingArtifex, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, I had the opportunity to guide and educate over <strong>1000 students</strong>. BeingArtifex is a student learning community that focuses on fostering technical and leadership skills among students. My mentorship covered a broad range of topics including <strong>Python Programming</strong>, <strong>Arduino</strong>, <strong>IoT</strong>, <strong>C++ Programming</strong>, and various design and management skills.</p>
        
        <p>One of our notable initiatives was <strong>Skillathon</strong>, an event designed to introduce school students to the world of technology early on. In the second edition of Skillathon, I served as the event coordinator, ensuring the program ran smoothly and effectively.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond Skillathon, I also delivered numerous talks and seminars at our college, educating fellow students about <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>. These sessions aimed to inspire and equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in these fields.</p>
        
        <p>My role at BeingArtifex involved teaching essential <strong>programming languages</strong> and tools, as well as providing insights into <strong>public speaking</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong>. This experience was fulfilling as it allowed me to contribute to the development of aspiring technologists and leaders.</p>
        
        <p>BeingArtifex was instrumental in honing my leadership skills and deepening my knowledge across multiple technical domains.</p>
