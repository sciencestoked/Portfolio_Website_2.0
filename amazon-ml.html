    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>At the Amazon ML School, I delved deep into the world of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. The program provided comprehensive training in <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>, <strong>Deep Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>, and other advanced ML techniques. I gained hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge that enabled me to work on real-world industry problems.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the course, I collaborated with <strong>Amazon Scientists</strong> and applied the concepts learned to practical challenges. This experience not only solidified my understanding of <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong> but also enhanced my skills in <strong>model evaluation</strong> and <strong>feature engineering</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The program was instrumental in shaping my career as a data scientist and provided me with a solid foundation to tackle complex ML problems.</p>
