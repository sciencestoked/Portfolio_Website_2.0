        <h2>Ugo Inc Internship: Autonomous Navigation with Lidar Mapping</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>During my offline internship at Ugo Inc, I had the opportunity to work on developing and deploying advanced robotic solutions, focusing on autonomous navigation using lidar mapping. The project was divided into two main workspaces: <strong>lidar_test</strong> for mapping and <strong>final_navigation</strong> for autonomous navigation.</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project was to achieve autonomous navigation using lidar mapping. This involved creating a detailed map of the environment using a lidar sensor and then using that map to navigate the robot autonomously. The project structure was organized into various packages, each serving a specific purpose.</p>

        <h3>Workspace: lidar_test</h3>
        <p>The <strong>lidar_test</strong> workspace was primarily focused on mapping. Here are the key packages and their functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>hector_slam:</strong> Used for mapping. The <code>mapping_default.launch</code> file was modified for mapping with joystick control.</li>
            <li><strong>joy:</strong> Facilitates joystick control for the mapping process.</li>
            <li><strong>Odometry Calculator:</strong> Receives twist messages and calculates odometry, then publishes it.</li>
            <li><strong>my_package:</strong> Receives data from the server and publishes it as twist messages for odometry.</li>
            <li><strong>ngk_kart_desc:</strong> Contains the URDF description of the robot.</li>
            <li><strong>rplidar_ros:</strong> Responsible for launching the RPLidar sensor.</li>
            <li><strong>twist_to_array:</strong> Reads <code>cmd_vel</code> data and converts it into an array for robot movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Workspace: final_navigation</h3>
        <p>The <strong>final_navigation</strong> workspace was dedicated to achieving autonomous navigation. Here are the key packages and their functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>my_odometry_calculator:</strong> Similar to the package in the <strong>lidar_test</strong> workspace, it calculates odometry from twist messages and publishes it.</li>
            <li><strong>my_package:</strong> Receives data from the server and publishes it as twist messages for odometry.</li>
            <li><strong>ngk_kart_desc:</strong> Contains the URDF description of the robot.</li>
            <li><strong>twist_to_array:</strong> Reads <code>cmd_vel</code> data and converts it into an array for robot movement.</li>
            <li><strong>my_launcher:</strong> This is the main navigation stack package consisting of configurations for costmaps, a launch file for running all the nodes required for autonomous navigation, and a saved maps folder. It also contains a script to publish dynamic transformations from the Odom frame to <code>base_footprint</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running the Autonomous Navigation</h3>
        <p>To achieve autonomous navigation, the following steps were performed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch the navigation stack: <code>roslaunch my_launcher launch-all.launch</code></li>
            <li>Open Rviz to visualize the navigation components.</li>
            <li>Set the initial 2D pose to align the laser scan with the map boundary for an approximate initial position.</li>
            <li>Set a 2D point and pose as the final navigation goal.</li>
            <li>The robot attempts to navigate to the specified goal.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>My offline internship at Ugo Inc was a remarkable experience that allowed me to delve deeply into autonomous navigation and lidar mapping. By working on this project, I was able to enhance my skills in robotics and gain practical experience in developing advanced robotic solutions. The hands-on approach and the challenges faced during the project were instrumental in my professional growth.</p>
