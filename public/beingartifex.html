    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>At BeingArtifex, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, I mentored over <strong>1000 students</strong>, covering a wide range of topics including <strong>Python Programming</strong>, <strong>Arduino</strong>, <strong>IoT</strong>, <strong>C++ Programming</strong>, and various design and management skills. BeingArtifex is a student-driven community dedicated to fostering technical and leadership skills.</p>
        
        <p>One of our flagship initiatives was <strong>Skillathon</strong>, designed to introduce school students to technology. As the event coordinator for the second edition, I ensured the event's success by overseeing its smooth execution.</p>
        
        <p>I also conducted numerous talks and seminars on <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, aimed at equipping students with the knowledge and skills to excel in these fields.</p>
        
        <p>My role involved teaching essential <strong>programming languages</strong> and tools, and providing insights into <strong>public speaking</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong>. This experience allowed me to contribute significantly to the development of future technologists and leaders.</p>
        
        <p>BeingArtifex played a crucial role in honing my leadership skills and deepening my knowledge across multiple technical domains.</p>
